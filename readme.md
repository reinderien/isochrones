Introduction
------------

This is a project to explore astro-geological calculation and visualisation for
Muslim prayer times. It's not meant to be authoritative (either scientifically
or religiously); it's only for fun and interest. It's written from a
perspective having only an introductory familiarity with the complex and
nuanced Muslim praxis.

Terminology
-----------

[Salah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salah) is the practice of daily Muslim prayer.

The [Kaaba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaaba) is the geographical centre of the Islam religion
and the location to which Muslims face when praying.

The typical five daily salah prayers are

- fajr (dawn),
- dhuhr (noon),
- asr (afternoon),
- maghrib (dusk), and
- isha (night).

This code follows the schedule definitions from [Hamid's prayer time explainer](http://www.praytimes.org/calculation/).
