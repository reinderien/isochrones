Introduction
------------

This is a project to explore astro-geological calculation and visualisation for
Muslim prayer times. It's not meant to be authoritative (either scientifically
or religiously); it's only for fun and interest. It's written from a
perspective having only an introductory familiarity with the complex and
nuanced Muslim praxis.

Terminology
-----------

[Salah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salah) (صَلَاة)
is the practice of daily Muslim prayer.

The [Kaaba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaaba) (ٱلْكَعْبَة)
in [Mecca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca) (مكة),
Saudi Arabia is the geographical centre of the Islam religion. Muslims face
toward it via [geodesic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesics_on_an_ellipsoid)
in the [qibla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qibla) (قِبْلَة)
direction when praying.

The typical five daily salah prayers are

- fajr (dawn),
- dhuhr (noon),
- asr (afternoon),
- maghrib (dusk), and
- isha (night).

Implementation
--------------

This code follows the schedule definitions from
[Hamid's prayer time guide](http://www.praytimes.org/calculation/).
